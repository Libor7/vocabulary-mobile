# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Security notes

Known high severity vulnerabilities reported by npm audit are related to
build-time tooling (`glob`, `node-forge`) and do not affect the runtime
React Native application.

They will be addressed during future Expo SDK upgrades.

## How to add a new language

To add a new language to this application, create a new folder inside the `locales` directory.
The folder name must be a valid language tag (for example `es`, `fr`, `it`).

Inside this folder, create the same JSON files as in the existing language folders
(e.g. `content.json`, `words.json`) and provide all required translations.

After adding the new language, start the application using:

```bash
npm start
```

This will automatically regenerate the app/i18n/resources.generated.ts file. Do not edit this file manually.

## Generating lesson word mappings

This application derives lesson-to-word mappings from translation keys.

### Source files

- `app/locales/en/words.json` – source of translation keys (order matters)
- `app/content/lessonWordRanges.ts` – defines how many words belong to each lesson

### Generated file

- `app/content/lessonWords.generated.ts` – auto-generated, do not edit manually

### How to regenerate

Whenever you change:

- `words.json`
- or `lessonWordRanges.ts`

run:

```bash
npm run generate:lesson-words
```

Whenever `words.json` changes, `lessonWordRanges.ts` must be updated accordingly.
